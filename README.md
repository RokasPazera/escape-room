## Game Logic Flow

### Challenge 1 â€“ Ping Pong  
- Ball moves, player moves paddle  
- Missed ball = fail  
- Hit 5 times = pass

### Challenge 2 â€“ Morse Code  
- Display Morse clue  
- Wait for correct input  
- Retry on wrong guess

### Challenge 3 â€“ Simon Says  
- Show LED sequence  
- Player repeats  
- Mistake = restart game

### Challenge 4 â€“ Final Equation  
- Solve displayed equation  
- Correct = win music ðŸŽµ  
- Wrong = retry

Incorrect actions or timeouts will trigger a buzzer and flashing LEDs.
